          Weather Widget
        </h1>
        <p>
          This Application (Widget) shows the current weather in the specified
          cities and is designed to operate in computers as well as in mobile
          devices. To add the widget to website, it is necessary only to put the
          following snippet into the page:
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: center">
          <code class="snippet">
            &lt;weather-widget&gt;&lt;/weather-widget&gt;<br />
            &lt;script type="text/javascript" src={ url to app
            }&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>
          The Application receives the weather information from the OpenWeather
          resource. The weather updating for each city is performed during
          returning from the setup mode or page reloading but not more often
          than once in 10 minutes according to the OpenWeather recommendation.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the initial loading, the setup mode is switched on
          automatically and the user is offered to put in the name of the city
          e.g. Moscow, Saint Petersburg, New York, San Francisco etc. In case of
          an error in the name of the city, the message “The city is not found”
          will appear on the screen. If the entered city exists in the list
          already, the message “The city is present already in the list” will
          appear on the screen and the sending of request will be impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Changing of the order in the list of cities is carried out using the
          option
          <span class="drag">drag’n’drop</span>
          implemented for screens of desktop as well as mobile devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          The widget configuration settings are stored in the reactive array of
          the Application and serialized into the local storage upon completion
          of the work. At the beginning of the next session of the widget, the
          data are loaded from the storage. All data can be deleted by the
          service button Reset.
        </p>
